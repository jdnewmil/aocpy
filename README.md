This package is a place for me to keep track of [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions in Python. There is no
guarantee that this code works, or that I would use or recommend that
any of the approaches applied here be used again… it is experimental.
Warning: I rarely complete all days of AOC in any given year… this is a
busy time of year.

The samples are tested using pytest, and the code is segregated by day.
The code is invoked on the user data in a [Quarto](https://quarto.org)
file for each year outside the aocpy package. User data supplied by AOC
is considered copyrighted by that website so is not stored in this repo.
You are expected to have access to the AOC website if you wish to know
the problem statements and obtain your own user data.
